\epigraph{\emph{Moral of the story: never read the documentation, bad things happen.}}{David Carlisle}

When I released the very first version of \arara on a Friday 13th, April 2012, I never thought the tool would receive so many positive comments and feedback. To be honest, since \arara was written for helping me with my own personal \LaTeX\ projects, I really doubted if the tool could be of service to anyone else. And, to my surprise, it seems \arara did good. To a lot of people around the \TeX\ world.

I never intended to release the tool to the whole world, since I wasn't sure if other people could benefit from \arara's features. After all, there's already a plethora of tools available to the \TeX\ community in general, although with different approaches. The reason I decided to make \arara publicly available is quite simple: I wanted to somehow contribute to the \TeX\ community, and I wanted to give my best to make such community even more awesome.

As time goes by, I'm quite satisfied with the current state of \arara~--~this is our 3rd major release. We have reached a very mature code and a great team of developers, translators and testers. Since version 1.0, the code evolved a lot -- new features, lots of bug fixes, improvements -- thanks to all the feedback I received. In my humble opinion, that's how any project should evolve: based on what our users expect and want to achieve. I'm proud to see \arara being 100\% community-driven, it's a big achievement for a project with less than one year old.

First of all, I'd like to thank some friends of mine that really made \arara possible: Alan Munn, for providing great ideas and suggestions to the manual; Andrew Stacey, for heavily testing \arara, providing great user cases, and for suggesting improvements to the program; Brent Longborough, a member of the core team, for providing great suggestions and ideas to the program logic, writing rules, testing the code and also for working with the Portuguese and Turkish translations; Clemens Niederberger, for testing \arara, and also writing a great tutorial about it in his \href{http://www.mychemistry.eu/2012/06/arara-automate-latex-birds-music/}{blog on chemistry and \LaTeX}; David Carlisle, for reminding me to work on \arara, and also encouraging me to write answers about it in our \TeX\ community; Enrico Gregorio, for reviewing the original manual, testing \arara, providing great ideas and suggestions to the manual and to the program itself, and for working with the Italian translation; Francesco Endrici, for providing the very first \arara rule outside our core team; Harish Kumar, for being a heavy \arara user and integrating it with WinEdt and Inlage; \.Ilhan Polat for working with Brent in the Turkish translation; Joseph Wright, for testing it, providing contributed code for Linux and Mac installations, and also blogging about \arara in his 
     \href{http://www.texdev.net}{personal blog}; Gonzalo Medina, for providing the Spanish translation; Mikaël Maunier, for providing the French translation; Marco Daniel, one of core team members, for heavily testing \arara, suggesting enhancements to the manual and to the program itself, providing lots of contributed rules for common tasks, and also for the German version; Patrick Gundlach, for advertising \arara in the official Twitter channel of \href{http://www.dante.de}{Dante} -- the German \TeX\ User Group; Stefan Kottwitz, for encouraging me to write an article about \arara, published in the \href{http://latex-community.org/know-how/435-gnuplot-arara}{\LaTeX\ Community} forum, and also tweeting about it. Thank you very much. I'm sorry if I forgot to mention somebody, I really have so much people to thank and my memory happens to be very short.

That said, I still believe that the warning featured in the first version of this manual still applies: \textsc{Hic Sunt Dracones}. Though the code really evolved from the first commit I made, \arara is far from being bug-free. And you will learn that \arara gives you enough rope. In other words, \emph{you} will be responsible for how \arara behaves and all the consequences from your actions. Sorry to sound scary, but I really needed to tell you this. After all, one of \arara's greatest features is the freedom it offers. But as you know, freedom always comes at a cost. Please, don't send us angry letters -- or e-mails, perhaps -- if something bad happen.

Feedback is surely welcome for me to improve this humble tool, just write an 
e-mail to me or any other member of the team and we will reply as soon as possible. The source code is fully available at \url{http://github.com/cereda/arara}, feel free to contribute to the project by forking it, submitting bugs, sending pull requests or even translating it to your language. If you want to support the \LaTeX\ development by a donation, the best way to do this is donating to the \href{http://www.tug.org/}{\TeX\ Users Group}. Please also  consider joining our \TeX\ community at \href{http://tex.stackexchange.com}{StackExchange}.

\noindent\arara also makes use of some specific opensource Java projects and libraries in order to properly work. I would like to thank the following projects and their respective developers:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \href{http://commons.apache.org}{Apache Commons}, a project from the Apache Foundation focused on all aspects of reusable Java components. \arara uses three of the Commons libraries: \href{http://commons.apache.org/cli/}{CLI}, which provides a command line arguments parser, \href{http://commons.apache.org/collections/}{Collections}, a library which  	extends the Java Collections Framework, and \href{http://commons.apache.org/exec/}{Exec}, an API for dealing with external process execution and environment management in Java.

\item \href{http://logback.qos.ch}{Logback}, a logging framework intended to be the successor to the popular \href{http://logging.apache.org/log4j/}{log4j} project. According to some benchmarks, it is faster and has a smaller footprint than all existing logging systems, sometimes by a wide margin.

\item \href{http://code.google.com/p/snakeyaml}{SnakeYAML}, a YAML parser and emitter for the Java programming language. YAML is a data serialization format designed for human readability and interaction with scripting languages. \arara uses YAML as the rule format.

\item \href{http://www.slf4j.org/}{SLF4J}, a simple facade or abstraction for various logging frameworks, allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.

\item \href{http://mvel.codehaus.org}{MVEL}, a powerful expression language for Java-based applications. It provides a plethora of features and is suited for everything from the smallest property binding and extraction, to full blown scripts. \arara relies on MVEL to provide the expansion mechanism for rules.

\item \href{http://maven.apache.org/}{Apache Maven}, a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model, Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information. 

\item \href{http://izpack.github.com}{IzPack}, a Java-based software installer builder that will run on any operating system coming with a Java Virtual Machine that is compliant with the Oracle JVM 1.5 or higher.
\end{enumerate}

A special thanks goes to my great friend \href{http://antoineneveux.fr/}{Antoine Neveux} for encouraging me to try out the \href{http://maven.apache.org}{Apache Maven} software project management. In the past, \arara was released as a NetBeans project, which is based on \href{http://ant.apache.org/}{Apache Ant}, another great tool from the Apache Foundation. Although I'm really fine with Ant, thanks to Maven, now it is way easier to build and to maintain the code. And it's always nice to learn another tool.

And at last but not least, I want to thank you, dear reader and potential user, 
for giving \arara a try. Do not despair if you don't succeed with \arara at first; just try again. I'm sure you will find your way. This humble project is opensource and it will always be. Let the bird be your guide through the journey to the typographic land. Have a good read.

\section*{Release information}

\subsection*{Version 3.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\newfeature] 
     List of new features and a table containing the lines of code for
     version 3.0.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 2.0}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\newfeature] 
     Added the |--timeout n| flag to allow setting a timeout for every task. If
     the timeout is reached before the task ends, \arara will kill it and 
     interrupt the processing. The $n$ value is expressed in milliseconds.
\item[\bugfix] 
     Fixed the |--verbose| flag to behave as a realtime output.
\item[\newfeature] 
     There's no need of noninteractive commands anymore. \arara can now handle
     user input through the |--verbose| tag. If the flag is not set and the 
     command requires user interaction, the task execution is interrupted.
\item[\bugfix] 
     Fixed the execution of some script-based system commands to ensure 
     cross-platform compatibility.
\item[\newfeature] 
     Added the |@{SystemUtils}| orb tag to provide specific operating system 
     checks. The orb tag maps the |SystemUtils| class from the amazing 
     \href{http://commons.apache.org/lang/}{Apache Commons Lang} library and 
     all of its methods and properties.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Version 1.0.1}

\begin{itemize}
\item[\newfeature] 
     Added support for |.tex|, |.dtx| and |.ltx| files. When no extension is 
     provided, \arara will automatically look for these extensions in this 
     specific order.
\item[\newfeature] 
     Added the |--verbose| flag to allow printing the complete log in the 
     terminal. A short |-v| tag is also available. Both |stdout| and |stderr| 
     are printed.
\item[\bugfix] 
     Fixed exit status when an exception is thrown. Now \arara also returns a 
     non-zero exit status when something wrong happened. Note that this 
     behaviour happens only when \arara is processing a file.
